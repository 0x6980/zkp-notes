## Polynomial
- Let $P(x) = p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + \dots + p_dx^d$
## Coefficients representations
- $P(x): [p_0, p_1,\dots,p_d]$
## Value representations
- Any polynomial of degree $d$ can be uniquely represented by $d+1$ points.
- $\{(x_0, P(x_0)),(x_1, P(x_1)),\dots, (x_d, P(x_d))\}$.
- Examples: 
    - Two points, there is exactly one line that goes through these two points.
    - Three points, there is exactly one quadratic function that goes through all there of these points.
    - Four points, there is exactly one cubic function that goes through all these points.
## Evaluation
- Mean: coefficients representations => value representations
- $P(x) = p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + \dots + p_dx^d$
- Evaluate at $n \geqslant d +1$ points.
- I pick $1, 2,\dots , n$ as $n$ points. So we have:

```math
\begin{aligned}
(1, P(1)) = (1, p_0 + p_1.1 + p_2.1^2 + \dots + p_d.1^d)\space\space\space\text{take}\space O(d)\space\text{operations}\\
(2, P(2)) = (2, p_0 + p_1.2 + p_2.2^2 + \dots + p_d.2^d)\space\space\space\text{take}\space O(d)\space\text{operations}\\
\vdots\\
(n, P(n)) = (n, p_0 + p_1.n + p_2.n^2 + \dots + p_d.n^d)\space\space\space\text{take}\space O(d)\space\text{operations}
\end{aligned}
```

- Each evaluation will take $O(d)$ operations, then all evaluations take $O(nd)$ which ends up being $o(d^2)$ to evaluate all $n$ points.
- **Question**: Can we find a way to optimize this?
- Instead of considering $P(x)$, we wanted to instead just evaluate a simple polynomials like $p(x) = x^2$ and $p(x) = x^3$ and evaluate at 8 points.
- Which points we should pick?
- Is there any set of points when knowing value of one point **immediately** implies the value of another?
- **In fact there is**:
    - If we pick $x=1$ we immediately know the value of the point $x=-1$. Similarly:

    ```math
    \begin{aligned}
    (1, 1) \space\space&\text{immediately know the value} \space\space (-1, 1)\\
    (2, 4) \space\space&\text{immediately know the value} \space\space (-2, 4)\\
    (3, 9) \space\space&\text{immediately know the value} \space\space (-3, 9)\\
    (4, 16) \space\space&\text{immediately know the value} \space\space (-4, 16)
    \end{aligned}
    ```

    - Extending this idea the key property we want here is that our eight points should be **positive** and **negative** pairs
    - The reason this works is due to property of even functions where a function evaluated a $-x$ is going to equal the function evaluated at positive $x$
    - So $P(-x) = P(x)$.
    - What about $P(x) = x^3$? Dose the same trick work?
    - It actually kind of does but one caveat. Each positive $x$ value will have the same value as negative $x$ value but with sign flipped
    
    ```math
    \begin{aligned}
    (1, 1) \space\space&\text{immediately know the value} \space\space (-1, -1)\\
    (2, 8) \space\space&\text{immediately know the value} \space\space (-2, -8)\\
    (3, 27) \space\space&\text{immediately know the value} \space\space (-3, -27)\\
    (4, 64) \space\space&\text{immediately know the value} \space\space (-4, -64)
    \end{aligned}
    ```

    - So, $P(-x) = -P(x)$.
- So, in these two cases of odd and even degree single term polynomials **instead of evaluating 8 individual points we can actually get away with evaluating exactly 4 positive points**, which we immediately know the value of the respective negative points
- More general example:
    - $P(x) = 3x^5 + 2x^4 + x^3 + 7x^2+ 5x + 1$.
    - Evaluate at $n$ points $\pm x_1, \pm x_2,\dots, \pm x_{\frac{n}{2}}$.
    - Split polynomial into even and odd degree terms: 
        - $P(x) = (2x^4 + 7x^2 + 1) + (3x^5 + x^3 + 5x)$.
    - Factor an $x$ from the odd degree terms: 
        - $P(x) = (2x^4 + 7x^2 + 1) + x(3x^4 + x^2 + 5)$.
    - We have two new polynomials have only even degree terms: $P_e(x^2), P_o(x^2)$.
    - $P(x) = P_e(x^2) + xP_o(x^2)$.
    - $P_e(x^2), P_o(x^2)$ have degree 2.
    
    ```math
    \begin{aligned}
    P(x_i) &= P_e(x_i^2) + x_iP_o(x_i^2)\\
    P(-x_i) &= P_e(x_i^2) - x_iP_o(x_i^2)
    \end{aligned}
    ```

## Generalization the observation to a polynomial with degree n-1
- We want evaluate at $n$ points.
- We can split the polynomial into even and odd terms with smaller polynomials $P_e(x^2), P_o(x^2)$ with degree $\frac{n}{2}-1$.
- So how do we evaluate these polynomials with half the degree of our original polynomial?
    - This is just another evaluation problem. But this time we need evaluate the polynomials at each of our original inputs squared.
    - Evaluate $P_e(x^2), P_o(x^2)$ each at $x_1^2, x_2^2,\dots, x_{\frac{n}{2}}^2$. ($\frac{n}{2}$ points).
    - Same process on simpler problem.
    - The start of recursive algorithm

## Bigger picture
- We want to evaluate a polynomial $P(x)$ at $n$ points with positive and negative paired.
- $P(x): [p_0, p_1,\dots,p_{n-1}]$ and $[\pm x_1, \pm x_2,\dots, \pm x_{\frac{n}{2}}]$.
- We split the polynomial: $P(x) = P_e(x^2) + xP_o(x^2)$.
- We now have two simpler polynomials of degree $\frac{n}{2} -1$ and only need $\frac{n}{2}$ points to evaluate.
    - $P_e(x^2): [p_0, p_2, p_4,\dots,p_{n-2}]$ and $[x_1^2, x_2^2,\dots, x_{\frac{n}{2}}^2]$.
        - $[P_e(x_1^2), P_e(x_2^2), P_e(x_4^2), \dots, P_e(x_{\frac{n}{2}}^2)]$.
    - $P_o(x^2): [p_1, p_3, p_5,\dots,p_{n-1}]$ and $[x_1^2, x_2^2,\dots, x_{\frac{n}{2}}^2]$.
        - $[P_o(x_1^2), P_o(x_2^2), P_o(x_4^2), \dots, P_o(x_{\frac{n}{2}}^2)]$.
- Once we recursively evaluate these smaller polynomials we can then go through every point in our original set of $n$ points and calculate the respective values by utilizing the relationship between the positive and negative paired points.

```math
\begin{aligned}
&P(x_i) = P_e(x_i^2) + x_iP_o(x_i^2)\\
&P(-x_i) = P_e(x_i^2) - x_iP_o(x_i^2)\\
&i = {1, 2, \dots, \frac{n}{2}}
\end{aligned}
```

- This gives us the **value representation** of our original polynomial $P(x)$

```math
[P(x_1),P(-x_1), P(x_2),P(-x_2),\dots,P(x_{\frac{n}{2}}),P(-x_{\frac{n}{2}})]
```

- So, we have **$O(n \log n)$ Recursive Algorithm**. Since the two recursive sub problems have half the size of the original problem and take linear time to evaluate $n$ points.
- This would be huge improvement from our earlier quadratic running time. But
## One major problem:
    - The problem occurs at the recursive steps.
    - The entire scheme relies on the fact that the polynomial will have positive and negative paired points for evaluation.
    - This works at the top level but next level we are evaluating $\frac{n}{2}$ points where each point is squared value.
    - These all end up being positive so the recursion breaks.
    
    ```math
    [\pm x_1, \pm x_2,\dots, \pm x_{\frac{n}{2}}] \space\space\space\space \text{are} \pm\space\text{paired.}
    ```
    
    ```math
    [x_1^2, x_2^2,\dots, x_{\frac{n}{2}}^2] \space\space\space\space \text{are not} \pm\space\text{paired.}
    ```
    
    - **The natural question is can we make these new set of points $[x_1^2, x_2^2,\dots, x_{\frac{n}{2}}^2]$, $\pm$ paired?**
    - **Ingenious Idea behind FFT**: The only way this is possible is if we expand the domain of possible initial points include **complex number**.
    - For special choice of complex numbers the recursive relation works perfectly where every subsequence set of points will contain $\pm$ pairs.
    - What possible set of initial $n$ points has this property?

### What possible set of initial n points has this property?
- This is a hard question and to answer it we're going to do a little bit of reverse engineering with an example.
- Let $P(x) = x^3 + x^2 - x - 1$.
- Which requires at least $n = 4$ points for its **value representation**.
- These points need to $\pm$ pairs. So we can write them as $x_1, -x_1, x_2, -x_2$.
- We know that the recursive steps require that we evaluate the odd and even split of the polynomial at two points $x_1^2, x_2^2$.
- Key constraint here is that for the recursion to work these two points also have to be $\pm$ pairs.
- So we have an equivalence between $x_2^2$ and $-x_1^2$.
- At the bottom level of the recursion will have single point $x_1^4$
- $x_1 = 1$ then $-x_1 = -1$ implies $x_1^2 = 1. Then $x_2^2$ should be -1. Then we have to choose, $x_2 = i, -x_2 = -i$. then  $x_1^4 = 1$
- **Alternative Perspective** is Solution $x^4 = 1$. Since the bottom layer of the recursion the value of any of our original points to the power 4 was 1.
- We know this equation has 4 solutions. All of which are encompassed by a special set of points called the 4th roots of unity.
- Generalization..
### Another example
- Let $P(x) = x^5 + 2x^4 - x^3 + x^2+ 1$.
- Need $n \geq 6$ points. It is convenient choose power of 2. So, let $n = 8$.
- The result $x_i^8 = 1$
- The points are $8^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity.
### Generalization of n'th roots of unity
- Let $P(x) = p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + \dots + p_dx^d$
- Need $n \geq d+1$ points, $n = 2^k,\space k\in\Z$.
- The result $x_i^n = 1$
- The points are $n^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity.

### Visualize roots of unity
- $n^{th}$ roots of unity
- $n$ roots of unity
    - $z^n = 1$.
    - Evaluate $P(x)$ at $[1, \omega^1, \omega^2, \dots, \omega^{n-1}]$.
    - $(\omega^j, \omega^{j+\frac{n}{2}})$ are $\pm$ paired. Because $-\omega^j = \omega^{j+\frac{n}{2}}$.
- $\frac{n}{2}$ roots of unity.
    - Then evaluate $P_e(x^2), P_o(x^2)$ at $[1, \omega^2, \omega^4, \dots, \omega^{\frac{n}{2}-1}]$.

## Code FFT
- Let $P: [p_0,p_1,\dots, p_{n-1}]$ and $n$ in power of 2.

```math
\text{def FFT}(P):&&&&&&&&\\
    n = \text{len}(P)\\
    \text{if}\space n == 1:\\
       \text{return}\space P\\
    \omega = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}}\\
    P_e = [p_0,p_2,\dots, p_{n-2}]\\
    P_o = [p_1,p_3,\dots, p_{n-1}]\\
    y_e = FFT(P_e)\\
    y_o = FFT(P_o)\\
    y = [0] * n\\
    \text{for}\space\space j \space\space\text{in}\space\space \text{range}(\frac{n}{2}):\\
        y[j] = y_e[j] + \omega^j y_o[j]\\
        y[j+ \frac{n}{2}] = y_e[j] + -\omega^j y_o[j]\\
```
