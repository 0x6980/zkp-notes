## Monic Polynomial
- A non-zero univariate polynomial where the leading coefficient is 1.
- Example 
```math
x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x - 7
```

```math
x-2
```
- $3x^2 - 4$ is not a monic polynomial.

## Quadratic Polynomial
- A polynomial equation of the degree 2, which means it has at least one squared term.
- The general form of a quadratic equation is $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$.Â
