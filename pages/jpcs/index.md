# Introduction
I am writing a comprehensive book and tutorial series about the SP1 Hypercube (Jagged Commitment) scheme, designed to make this advanced cryptographic concept accessible even to beginners. My goal is to explain how the protocol works in an intuitive, step-by-step manner while maintaining technical accuracy.

I have already outlined the full structure of this project and plan to systematically implement each section, completing the series over time. The materials will include:
- Foundational explanations for newcomers
- Visualizations of hypercube-based commitments
- Interactive examples and code walkthroughs
- Advanced optimizations for practitioners

This will be a living resource, updated regularly to incorporate feedback and new developments in the field.
