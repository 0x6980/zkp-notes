## Lookup relation
### Definition
Given configuration $C_{LK} := \left(T, l, t\right)$ where $l$ is the number of lookups and $t\in\mathbb{F}^{T}$ is the lookup table. the relation $R_{LK}$ is the set of tuples $w\in\mathbb{F}^l$ such that $w_i\in t$ for all $i = 1, \dots, l$.
### Lemma
Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field of characteristic $p>\max(l, T)$. Given two sequence of field elements $[w_i]_{i=1}^{l}$ and $[t_j]_{j=1}^{T}$ we have $\{w_i\}\subseteq \{t_j\}$ as sets (with multiples of values removed) if and only if there exist a sequence $[m_j]_{j=1}^{T}$ of field elements such that
```math
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{l}\frac{1}{x+w_i} = \sum_{j=1}^{T}\frac{m_j}{x+t_j}
\end{equation}
```
- In the proof of this lemma we construct $m_j = \text{number of}\: i\: \text{s.t.} \: w_i = t_j$ (number of repetition $w_i$)



## Our puzzle
### Intro
We've implemented a range check for $[0, 2^6-1]$ using the special-sound
lookup protocol of [ProtoStar]([url](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/620))
(see Section 4.3, p. 34) which itself is a variant of [LogUp]([url](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1530)).
To make this faster, we use a â‰ˆ16-bit prime field and take challenges
from a larger extension to have roughly 100 bits of security.
- We should submit a passing proof that $2^{15}$ is in the expected range.
- Based on code the characteristic is `let p = 70937;` and the table is:
```rust
    let mut table = vec![];
    for i in 0..1 << 6 {
        table.push(FieldElement::new(vec![i], p, irr.clone()));
    }
```
### Definition of Characteristic
- The characteristic of a ring $mathbb{R}$, often denoted $\text{char}(\mathbb{R})$, is defined to be the smallest positive number of copies of the ring's multiplicative identity (1) that will sum to the additive identity (0). If no such number exists, the ring is said to have characteristic zero.
- $\underbrace{1 + \dots + 1}_\textrm{p summands} = 0$
- So, for any field element $a\in\mathbb{F}$ we have $p.a = 0$
### Solution
- We want to prove that $2^{15}$ is in the table.
- **We put $2^{15}$, $p$ times in the $w$**.
```rust
    let invalid_witness = FieldElement::new(vec![1<<15], p, irr.clone()); 

    /* BEGIN HACK */
    let mut witness = vec![];
    for _ in 0..70937  {
        witness.push(invalid_witness.clone());
    }
```
- Then, in the rhs of **(1)** this sum will be cancel out because in the field $\mathbb{F}$, the characteristic is $p$.
- So, in fact, we add zero times $2^{15}$ in the witness.
- **Since in the verifier part any functions not check this variant, So we easily can cheat on proof.**
- **I mean in the verifier side should check that $m_i \neq 0.$**
- So, We create a $w$ (witness) and $m$ which is invalid but passed in the verification. 
- and Done.
