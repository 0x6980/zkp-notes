## Group
Suppose $G$ is a set, and $*$ is a binary operator $* : G \times G \rarr G$\
Then $(G, *)$ is a group if 
1. $*$ is closed binary operator. So we have:
$$
\forall a,b \in G; \space \space a * b \in G 
$$
2. Associativity: 
$$
\forall a, b, c \in G; \space \space a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c 
$$
3. Identity: $G$ has identity element $e$.
$$
\exist e \in G \space s.t. \space \space \forall a \in G, \space \space a * e = e * a = a
$$
4. Inverse: Every element in $G$ have an inverse.
$$
\forall a \in G, \space \space \exist b \in G, \space \space s.t. \space \space a * b = b * a = e
$$

## Abelian (Commutative) Group
$(G, *)$ is a Abelian group if satisfies the Commutativity property:
$$
\forall a, b \in G, \space \space a * b = b * a.
$$ 

## Notation
We will denote the multiplicative and additive shorthand for iterated group operations by default. That is,
- for $g \in (G, \times), \space g^2 = g * g, \space g^3 = g * g * g$, and so forth. $g^{-1}$ for inverse. $1$ instead of identity element $e$.
- for $g \in (G, +), \space 2g = g * g, \space 3g = g * g * g$, and so forth. $-g$ for inverse. $0$ instead of identity element $e$.

## Order of a group
- The order of a group is the number of elements in it, namely $|g|$.
- If the group $G$ has finite element we say $G$ is finite group.

## Order of an element in group
For $g \in G$, the minimum integer $n$ such that $g^n = e$ called order of g.

## Generator
- Any element $g \in G$ that is able to generate $G$ is called a generator.
- Of course, every group G has a trivial set of generators, when we just consider every element of the group to be in the generator set

## Cyclic groups
Groups with single, not necessarily unique, generators are called cyclic groups.
