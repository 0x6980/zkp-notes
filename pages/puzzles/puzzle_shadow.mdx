## Noir lang
- Based on [Noir lang](
    https://noir-lang.org/docs/dev/getting_started/quick_start)

### `BoundedVec<T, MaxLen>`
- A `BoundedVec<T, MaxLen>` is a growable storage similar to a `Vec<T>` except that it is bounded with a maximum possible length.
- Example:
```rust
let mut vector: BoundedVec<Field, 10> = BoundedVec::new();
for i in 0..5 {
    vector.push(i);
}
assert(vector.len() == 5);
assert(vector.max_len() == 10);
```

### `max_len()`
- Returns the maximum length of the vector. This is always equal to the MaxLen parameter this vector was initialized with.
- In the example above `assert(vector.max_len() == 10);` shows that max length is 10.
- Also, it is abvouis because in the declaring of vector we simply used 10 as `MaxLen`.
### `len()`
- Returns the current length of the vector.
- In the example above we pushed 5 items in the `vector` and the another 5 items is still zero.
- As you can see, `assert(vector.len() == 5);` shows that the length of vector is 5.

### `sha256_var`
- Given an array of bytes, returns the resulting sha256 hash. Specify a `message_size` to **hash only the first `message_size` bytes of the input**.

## Puzzle
### Intro
A cutting-edge crypto company unveiled HTTP://JWT.PK, a revolutionary identity 
infrastructure platform designed to simplify private key management. By allowing 
users to register seamlessly with existing keys, the service promised to redefine convenience and 
security in the digital world. It allows users to send amounts up to $100 without having access to their 
private keys.

The registration process goes as follows: Users sign up with their existing 
public keys [pk](HTTP://JWT.PK) then samples a secret value called “pepper” and computes an identifier 
of the form: `{pub_key}_{pepper}`. SHA256 of the identifier is then added to the set of registered identifiers.

Users can later authenticate a transaction by simply providing a proof 
of knowledge of the whitelisted identifier formed by the (pk, pepper) pair without needing to use 
their private key at any step of the process.

Alice found out that Bob registered to HTTP://JWT.PK with a 
public key “BOB_pk”. She then registered using “ALICE_pk” and 
obtained “ALICE_pepper” from HTTP://JWT.PK.

### Code
- Here are the code in puzzle:
```rust
1: // THIS FILE CANNOT BE CHANGED
2: 
3: use noir_string_search::{StringBody, StringBody128, SubString, SubString32};
4:
5: // alice_pk = [155, 143, 27, 66, 87, 125, 33, 110, 57, 153, 93, 228, 167, 76, 120, 220, 178, 200, 187, 35, 211, 175, 104, 63, 140, 208, 36, 184, 88, 1, 203, 62]
6: // alice_pepper = [213, 231, 76, 105, 105, 96, 199, 183, 106, 26, 29, 7, 28, 234, 145, 69, 48, 9, 254, 205, 79, 21, 90, 13, 39, 172, 114, 59, 131, 15, 78, 118]
7:
8: fn main(identifier: BoundedVec<u8, 128>, pub_key: pub [u8; 32], whitelist: pub [[u8; 32]; 10]) {
9:     // the identifier hashes to a digest that is in the public whitelist
10:    let digest = std::hash::sha256_var(identifier.storage(), identifier.len() as u64);
11:    let mut present = false;
12:    for i in 0..whitelist.len() {
13:        if whitelist[i] == digest {
14:            present = true;
15:        }
16:    }
17:    assert(present);
18:
19:    // the specified public key is in the identifier
20:    let id_haystack: StringBody128 = StringBody::new(identifier.storage(), 128);
21:    let pk_needle: SubString32 = SubString::new(pub_key, 32);
22:    let (result, _): (bool, u32) = id_haystack.substring_match(pk_needle);
23:    assert(result);
24: }

```
- Line [5] is `alice_pk` and line [6] is `alice_pepper`.
- The `main` function have 3 parameters: 
    - `identifier` is type of `BoundedVec<u8, 128>`, and considered as private input constraint system,
    - `pub_key` is array of `u8` with size 32, and considered as public input constraint system,
    - `whitelist` is array of array of `u8` with size 32 and considered as public input constraint system.
- In line, [10]() the `sha256_var` method hashes the `identifier`.
- In lines, [11-17]() the `main` function wants to ensure that the `identifier` hash is in the `whitelist`.
- In lines, [20-23]() the `main` function wants to ensure that the `pub_key` is appear in the `identifier`.
- Based on puzzle instruction the `identifier` is equal to `{pub_key}_{pepper}`.

### `Prover.toml`
- In Noir lang, the `Prover.toml` file is where our input values will be specified.
- `nargo execute` command, compile and execute our Noir program. and generate the witness that we need to feed to our proving backend.
- Here is our `Prover.toml`:

## Solution
- Alice want to construct the `identifier` in such a way that it pretends to be logged in as Bob.
    - First, the `identifier` hash should be in `whitelist`.
    - Second, the `identifier` should include Bob's public key.
### First: the `identifier` hash should be in `whitelist`
- As below shows the byte of underline char(_) is 95.
```rust
fn main() {
    let underline = [95].as_str_unchecked();
    assert_eq(underline, "_");
}
```
- Now we want to construct the `identifier`, which is `{pub_key}_{pepper}`: 
```rust
5: // alice_pk = [155, 143, 27, 66, 87, 125, 33, 110, 57, 153, 93, 228, 167, 76, 120, 220, 178, 200, 187, 35, 211, 175, 104, 63, 140, 208, 36, 184, 88, 1, 203, 62]
6: // alice_pepper = [213, 231, 76, 105, 105, 96, 199, 183, 106, 26, 29, 7, 28, 234, 145, 69, 48, 9, 254, 205, 79, 21, 90, 13, 39, 172, 114, 59, 131, 15, 78, 118]
```
- So, By placing the `alice_pk` first, followed by the `95` as byte of "_", and finally adding the `alice_pepper`, we have created a 65-byte array as below:

storage = [155, 143, 27, 66, 87, 125, 33, 110, 57, 153, 93, 228, 167, 76, 120, 220, 178, 200, 187, 35, 211, 175, 104, 63, 140, 208, 36, 184, 88, 1, 203, 62, **95**, 213, 231, 76, 105, 105, 96, 199, 183, 106, 26, 29, 7, 28, 234, 145, 69, 48, 9, 254, 205, 79, 21, 90, 13, 39, 172, 114, 59, 131, 15, 78, 118, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
- In the `Prover.toml` file, by changing the `len = "128"` to `len = "65"` we can pass the **First** part of HACK.
- **Because the `sha256_var` take `identifier` and hash only the first `identifier.len()` bytes of the input.**
### Second: the `identifier` should include Bob's public key
- It is sufficient to place `BOB_pk` after 65th byte in the `storage` array. With this 32 bytes, the `storage` will have 97 bytes. This will satisfy the *Second* section which is "checking that the Bob's public key is appear in the identifier".
```rust
pub_key = [157, 133, 167, 136, 43, 161, 75, 166, 33, 14, 35, 106, 238, 18, 60, 56, 93, 209, 205, 52, 247, 110, 174, 192, 20, 58, 70, 42, 215, 98, 195, 150]
```
storage = [155, 143, 27, 66, 87, 125, 33, 110, 57, 153, 93, 228, 167, 76, 120, 220, 178, 200, 187, 35, 211, 175, 104, 63, 140, 208, 36, 184, 88, 1, 203, 62, **95**, 213, 231, 76, 105, 105, 96, 199, 183, 106, 26, 29, 7, 28, 234, 145, 69, 48, 9, 254, 205, 79, 21, 90, 13, 39, 172, 114, 59, 131, 15, 78, 118, **157, 133, 167, 136, 43, 161, 75, 166, 33, 14, 35, 106, 238, 18, 60, 56, 93, 209, 205, 52, 247, 110, 174, 192, 20, 58, 70, 42, 215, 98, 195, 150**, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

- **It is important to note that `identifier.len()` will not change with adding the 32 byte for `pub_key` and will return exactly the `len` that we specified in the `Prover.toml` file as input.**
