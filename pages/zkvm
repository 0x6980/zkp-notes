ZKVM : Generalizing ZKP (generating ZKPs for any program or computation)
1. A Program 
2. Machine code dictated by ISA
3. Execute machine code in arithmetized format(r1cs, plonkish, AIR)
4. Execution trace (Tables) 
5. Tables into polynomial and commitment to polynomials
6. Collection of commitment polynomials ==> Evaluation claims and opening proofs
7. Verify proofs
